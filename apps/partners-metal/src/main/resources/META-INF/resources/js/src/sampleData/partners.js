In order to increase productivity of organizations, we use and promote opensource products including those we lead and sponsor, as the digital sign project called Sinadura. We are co-founders of ESLE and ASOLIF opensource enterprise associations, spreading the value of the collaboration strategies to benefit our customers. The portfolio includes Enterprise Information Portals, Social & Collaboration Portals and Intranets based on Liferay since 2006, customizing the product to meet our client's needs and making integrations with other opensource products such as Pentaho BI, Nuxeo DM, Alfresco ECM, Moodle, Zimbra, e-id, or authentication and digital signature solutions. Zylk.net has experience in different sectors: government, town councils, university and education, as well as private corporations, and offers services from our headquarters, and the locations of our partner Bilbomatica in Bilbao, Madrid, Pamplona and Barcelona.",
